"Tracking food inventory in Refrigerator & Freezer" is a tool to help keep track of the shelf life of all foods stored 
in the refrigerator and freezer and prioritize which foods should be used before they are no longer safe to eat.

### Users
The target users of the software are all family members who are using the refrigerator every day.

### The motivation
Starting from the practical problem that I often forget to put many kinds of foods in the refrigerator/freezer for a 
long time, and I have to throw it away because it is spoiled, inedible. As a result, I directly wasted food and lost 
money on food every month. Through observation from reality, there are many people who have also been having problems 
like me in forgetting food for a long time in the refrigerator leading to spoilage. These things are the main 
motivation for me to come up with an idea and build this software to be able to track the food storage and the use of 
food in the refrigerator efficiently and scientifically.

### Main functions
1. Adding and storing the data **Type**, **Name**, **Date**, **Quantity** of food in the refrigerator/freezer.
2. Display a time chart of using time remaining of all foods in the refrigerator/freezer.
3. Set the priority of what food need to be used first.
